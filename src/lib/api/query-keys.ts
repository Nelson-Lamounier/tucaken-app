/**
 * Admin Query Key Factory
 *
 * Structured query keys for TanStack Query cache management.
 * Follows the recommended factory pattern for hierarchical invalidation:
 * - Invalidating `adminKeys.articles.all` clears all article-related queries.
 * - Invalidating `adminKeys.all` clears the entire admin cache.
 *
 * @see https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/query-keys
 */

/**
 * Centralised query key factory for the admin dashboard.
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```typescript
 * // In a useQuery hook
 * useQuery({ queryKey: adminKeys.articles.list('all'), queryFn: ... })
 *
 * // Cache invalidation after a mutation
 * queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: adminKeys.articles.all })
 * ```
